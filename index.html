		  <p class="paper-font-body1">
		    Thank you for visiting my webpage. I am still getting things set up, but feel free to learn about me in the About

		  <h2 class="paper-font-display2">About Me</h2>
		  <p class="paper-font-body1">
		    Recent graduate of Colorado School of Mines in Computer Science. Currently looking for work in any type of development, but I prefer to be in the 			    mobile space. While I job hunt I work on my own projects which can viewed on the projects page. Previous employers include The Integer Group as 			    a Development Intern and CCIT on the Mines campus as a Student Technical Consultant.  
		  </p>
		  <p class="paper-font-body1">
		    I find learning new programming languages to be an enjoyable experience. I had to do it on the job in one case with the Integer Group as I did not have any Objective-C experience to make an iOS app they were requesting as part of the internship. As part of my career goals I would like to learn every programming language I can so that I am able to look at a problem and know exactly what to pull out of my hat that would be the most effective and efficient.
		  </p>
		  <p class="paper-font-body1">
		    Working with a team in Agile and Scrum has been very effective for me in the past. School courses placed a heavy emphasis on doing these types of development when working on a larger project in a team. Working on a team in general has also been helpful for me. While I was a Student Consultant for the School we all worked as one team and shared our knowledge of particular problems to help better everyone troubleshoot and repair software. I was able to become the Training Lead and help teach new consultants basic problems that they would need to know how to fix on a regular basis.
		  </p>
		  <p class="paper-font-body1">
		    There is no one part of the stack that I prefer over another. On every project I have worked on in either a team or on my own I have had a hand in every piece of the stack from UI to back end server communications. I have studied the Material Design docs as well as the Apple UI docs to better understand how to handle the mobile UI. I have also studied how to effective write comments and reusable code to make more stable software. I have even done testing in my own applications.

		    <li><p class="paper-font-body1">Digital Opera/Raceday: Native iOS Application of Web Product (Full Stack)</p></li>
		      <ul>
		        <li><p class="paper-font-body1">
			  I was assigned to create a native iOS application, using Swift, that had some of the functionality of their web product. In the process I had to implement Apple Push Notifications, Passbook passes, Keychain access for logging in, and API calls to their Ruby on Rails server to retrieve information for use in the app. I was given a Sketch of how they wanted the application to look, and had to translate that into storyboards in the interface builder or build the view in code if the view needed to be dynamic. In the end the company ran out of the money that they had budgeted for the mobile application before it could be launched. It was a great experience that taught me more about about Swift than I had already known, and how it is still a growing language. During development I had to update to iOS 9.3 and handle what Apple had depreciated in Swift for the coming release of Swift 3.0.</p>

		    <li><p class="paper-font-body1">The Integer Group: Internal iOS Time Tracking Application (Full Stack)</p></li>
		      <ul>
		        <li><p class="paper-font-body1">
			  I was assigned to create an internal time tracking iOS application for tracking time worked while on the go, and possibly not connected to the internet. All I was given was a list of features the company wanted the app to have. I was the only person working on this project so I had to distill down requirements for the app, build the wireframes for approval, build the storyboards in Xcode from the wireframes, and build the back end code. I did not know any Objective-C during this process so I have to learn the language while on the job, and implementing it myself. At the end of the 10 week internship I had a functioning slide out menu to move between time tracking, jobs list, and settings screens, labels that would update with time tracked when saved, a call to the jobs server to download a person's favorite jobs and jobs available to them that they could add to their favorite list, a call to core data to save all of the jobs that had been downloaded for offline use, and a working log in to access the jobs server. Overall it was an enjoyable experience and found learning Objective-C on the run to be very rewarding.</p>
